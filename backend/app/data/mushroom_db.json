      "cap": "5-20 cm across, nearly flat, roundish to rosette-like, turns irregularly lobe with age; nearby fruit bodies often fused together. Its upper, sterile surface is initially white to off-white, then pink to reddish brown; smooth to slightly hairy (tomentose). Margin thin and paler than the rest of the upper surface, bruising reddish brown when handled or damaged.",
      "stem": "4-7 cm long and 2-3 cm thick, tapering towards the base, often deeply 'rooting'.",
      "pores": "Tubes 5-6 mm long, creamy white. Pores 1-3 per mm (sometimes even wider), irregularly angular to daedaleoid, slightly decurrent; white, staining pink to reddish if damaged.",
      "flesh": "Dual-layered (duplex), 8-10 mm thick. The upper (external) layer is soft and ochraceous, while the core or inner layer is a bit harder (corky) and more cream in colour.",
      "habitat": "On all kind of hardwood, often on buried roots, more rarely on conifers. Saprotrophic, causes white-rot, most of all in the roots of deciduous trees. Growing solitary or in smaller groups. Its main fruiting season is Late Summer to Autumn, but it can be found during the whole year.",
      "possibleConfusion": "Young, irregular fruit bodies secreteoozing red droplets. In this form it can be confused with Devil's Tooth (Hydnellum peckii) andor Mealy Tooth (Hydnellum ferrugineum), but both species can be found exclusively in old conifer forests, near Pine or Spruce, also these species have spines (teeth), not wide pores.\nThe regular fruit bodies might be confused with the rarer Zoned Rosette (Podoscypha multizonata), pictured, which also prefers hardwoods, especially Oaks, but Zoned Rosette doesn't have visible pores. If we look it more carefully it more reminds of a pink to red stained Wood Cauliflower (Sparassis crispa) than a Blushing Rosette.",

      "frequency": "Occasional and widespread in the UK.",
      "spores": "Spore print is white. Spores elliptical, colourless (hyaline), and thin walled with oil drops.",
      "otherFacts": "It often forms irregular, aberrant fruit bodies. It could be hemispherical with its pores upside-down, but even if it forms its regular, rosette form, the so-called 'rosecomb mutation' is rather common. In mycology, the term 'rosecomb mutation' is used when any kind of distortions, lumps or malformations occur on the cap and makes visible the gills or the pores.\nIts epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name which identifies the species within the genus) - biennis - suggests it is biennal, but it is incorrect, and likely based on the really variable appearance of this species.",

Thankfully there are a few features that help to recognise them as one of the Grisettes.\nAll the Grisettes are medium or big size agarics (mushrooms with distinct cap, gills and stem), their cap is smooth (except Snakeskin Grisette (Amanita ceciliae) which has thick velar greyish patches on it, and a few other species in this group), margin of their cap is striated, gills are white to cream coloured, there is no ring or skirt around their stem which could be either smooth, covered with a snakeskin-like pattern or with small flakes. Their stem is cylindrical or slightly tapering towards the top of the stem (apex), their volva is saccate (looks like a sac) and very often remains in the soil if you try to pick it.\nAlthough they are considered edible, caution must be taken if foraging for this mushroom as it can look similar to a Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) or another toxic member of the genus.",

Also the cap of the Devil's Bolete being a chalky white but this is less reliable as the cap can fade on older Scarletina Boletes.\nDeceiving bolete (Suillellus queletii) also has dots on the stem but they're yellow to buffgrey and not red.

Modern DNA studies split Boletus into smaller genus allocating this one in Neoboletus. More recently it came to light that the name “erythropus” had been previously used for a different species of Bolete which makes the name scientifically invalid. Recent books list it as “Neoboletus luridiformis” but “luridiformis” isn't a valid name under scientific rules either, and apparently “Boletus praestigiator” was the first valid description of this species. Newer books published after 2017 should be naming it as “Neoboletus praestigiator“.\nFurthermore, the Neoboletus group has a second species, currently named Neoboletus xanthopus, that is extremely similar to the Scarletina Bolete and impossible to differentiate without a DNA analysis. Thankfully this second species is equally edible and it's irrelevant to a forager to distinguish them so we treat the whole group here under Scarletina Bolete.",

There are two slightly different, but still connected explanations of the origin of the name of the genus, Byssomerulius.

Hallock (PhD) in his book, A Mushroom Word Guide : Etymology, PronounciationAild food Uk & Meaning of over 1.500 Words says, the Greek word 'Byssos' or 'Βύσσος' refers to 'a fine yellow flax'. Hallock forgot to mention that in Greek, 'byssos' can also mean a fine linen made of byssos-flax, and that linen was also yellowish.\nPat O'Reilly, the author of the book, Fascinated by Fungi, says “the genus name, comes via Greek from the Latin byssus, meaning fine silk-like cloth and is probably a reference to the many fine maze-like ridges that pattern the surface of these fungi rather like interlocking jigsaw pieces, and -merulius is the name (origin obscure) of the closely-related Merulius crust fungus genus.”\nWe aren't find the exact etymology of the word 'Merulius', but the word 'meruloid' means: wrinkled with uneven ridges.\nThe epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name) 'corium' comes from Latin, and it means 'leather'.",

It doesn't have a long shelf-life, a few days after it hatched its egg, it collapses and rots into the substrate.\nSame as all the stinkhorns, this species distributes its spores with the help of insects. The mushroom attracts the insects with its rotting meat-like odour. When the insects land on the inner surface of the mushroom, its spores (trapped into a mucous layer on the inner wall of the individual arms of the 'octopus') attach to their feet and in this way they will leave the spores behind wherever they landing after this encounter.",

      "otherFacts": "The Birch Polypore (Fomitopsis betulina), grows on Birch trees and can be a parasite to living trees slowly killing them and then living on the dead tree for many years until the tree has rotted to nothing.\nThe mushroom grows exclusively on Birch naturally but can be artificially introduced to other types of tree.\nIt has long been known that the Birch Polypore has medicinal uses, it has been used as a tonic for the immune system, as an antiseptic to clean wounds and promote healing, a plaster that is microporus, antifungal and antiseptic and probably was used by Bronze Age man to get rid of parasitic worms.\nIn 1991 Austrian hikers in the Tyrol region of the Italian Alps discovered a frozen corpse. When this was later examined it turned out to be a 5300 year old mummy that they named Ötzi. Ötzi had some Birch Polypore on a leather thong around his neck, he also had a parasitic intestinal worm called a Whipworm which can be cured with polyporenic acid which is one of the chemicals present in the Birch Polypore.\nAnother possible use of the fungus by Bronze Age man was as a very good tinder that can be started with a weak spark or used to transport fire as the fungus can smoulder for a long time and can be used to take to the next camp or destination and get a fire lit quickly without the long and laborious task of lighting a fire by friction.\nBirch trees contain betulinic acid which has many health benefits, there are also other chemicals in the Birch Polypore that are beneficial for being healthy. With modern research it is becoming clear that the Birch Polypore is an important mushroom to look into, tests have been carried out and so far found the following.\nAntiviral. In tests extracts from the Birch Polypore blocked reproduction in HIV cells, attacked and incapacitated encephalitis infections and has proved positive in treating flu, yellow fever and West Nile flu.\nAntibiotic. The Birch Polypore contains the antibiotic piptamine which has been used to treat e-coli.\nAnti inflammatory. There are several triterpene acids present and these are known anti-inflammatory substances.\nAnti Tumor. Betulinic acid and other chemicals in the fungi have been shown to cause apoptosis, the destruction of cancer cells while not affecting healthy cells.\nAntiseptic. For cleaning wounds and being an aid to healing.\nAntifungal. This mushroom does not like to share its habitat with other mushrooms and contains some powerful antifungals.\nStyptic. The fungus has styptic properties (it staunches bleeding).\nThe mushroom has very beneficial effects on the immune system and many people drink a tea made from the fresh or dried fungi and swear by its positive effects.\nA plaster can be made from the underside of the mushroom, a strip needs to be cut and carefully removed from the pore membrane. This provides a microporus, anti fungal, antiseptic and self sticking plaster, much better than can be purchased from the shops.\nA corn or blister plaster can be easily fashioned from the flesh of the mushroom by cutting some flesh into a doughnut shape of the right size and applying to the corn or blister.\nThe common name Razor Strop Fungus comes from the use in old barber shops of cutting a strip from the underside of the fungus, drying it and sticking it to a piece of flat wood. This was used to give the final finish to the cut throat razors that barbers used. I'm not sure if they were aware of the fact but in doing so they were giving their blades an antiseptic, antifungal and styptic wipe!\nThe fungus has also been used in the past as very fine emery cloth to polish metals, making ink blotters and even bases for mounting insects for collections.\nTruly the Swiss Army knife of mushrooms.",

Often covered with brown spore powder.\nSpore-bearing tissue of the 'head', called the 'gleba' is creamy and solid (cheese-like) when immature, powdery and brown when the spores matured.\nOuter layer (exoperidium) cracks up to 5-8 arms. The inner surface of the arms brake off and form a saucer or collar-like structure (hence the common English name). It is more or less creamy in the inside, darker brownish on the outside. The arms bend round underneath the fruitbody and lift it up from the soil.",

In a recent phylogeny study by Zamora JC et al (2014) proved that G. michelianum and G. saccatum are two different species from two different sections of genus Geastrum.\nThe peristom of Sessile Earthstar (Geastrum fimbriatum) doesn't have a boundary-halo, also, the inner layer of its arms doesn't brake off and form a collar, not to mention that it is smaller than the Collared Earthstar (Geastrum michelianum).",

The epithet (2nd part of the scientific name) refers to the mostly visible three layers of the mature fruit body: the spherical head or spore sac (endoperidium), the broken off inner layer of the arms, and the arms (exoperidium).\nUntil recently it was called as Geastrum triplex, however, the original Geastrum triplex was described from a Tropical deciduous forest on Java, Indonesia, and has a different DNA to our European Geastrum “triplex“, so we tend to use its former name, Geastrum michelianum, which - in our opinion - should be the valid scientific name of the European species.",

Serious cases lead to liver and kidney damage as well as seizures and coma, sometimes resulting in death.\nThe amount of gyromitrin varies a lot from collection to collection but it's usually very high. Consumed raw or in large amounts it can be fatal. However this mushroom and related species have a long history of consumption in parts of Europe and North America.\nGyromitrin is volatile and soluble in water and it's possible to remove most of it following a rigorous method. The processing should be done outdoors or on a well ventilated space to avoid inhaling the highly toxic vapours. We don't recommend trying unless you understand very well the caveats associated with this species and toxin.\nThere are many species of Gyromitra spread across the World, some more distinct than others. A couple of these contain high amounts of gyromitrin, others only contain trace amounts and some may not even contain the toxin. This leads to much confusion and debate among mycologists and foragers in different geographic areas. Most authors currently dismiss all Gyromitra species as suspicious, but in some areas the local species are regarded as edible after simple cooking. We use the term “False Morel” to specifically refer to Gyromitra esculenta, the most commonly recorded Gyromitra species in the UK. Enthusiasts see it as a derogatory term for this unique fungi, but this is the official common name sanctioned by the British Mycological Society.",

The Deadly Fibrecap is known for containing a deadly amount of muscarine and deaths associated to this mushroom have occurred in the UK and Continental Europe in the past century. The antidote for muscarine poisoning is atropine, a substance better known for being the main toxin in the Deadly Nightshade plant.

However we have also had reports of severe gastric upsets after consumption from Yew. In any case, the toxic alkaloids found in Yew are very resilient and can be found even on dead wood and fallen needles. Therefore specimens collected from Yew should be very carefully inspected, trimmed and cleaned thoroughly to remove any needles or wood debris trapped inside. At this point we cannot recommend collecting Chicken of the Woods from Yew as safe. It is a common fungus and you should be able to find it in other trees.\nVery popular in North America where they sometimes blanch and freeze it although when I have tried this it tends to become very woody, it is best eaten when young and fresh.",

The confusion with other lepiotas which are smaller can be ignored if the mushroom cap is over twelve centimetres in diametre, when mature nothing that looks similar is anywhere near as big apart from the Shaggy Parasol (Chlorophyllum rhacodes), pictured. The shaggy does not grow quite as large and is slightly off-white to dusty in colour, the stem has no snakeskin effect and the flesh stains red when cut. We think it's just as tasty but it can cause mild gastric upsets in a small number of people.",

You can often spot them from quite a distance along the edges of fields, woods and roads.\nParasols are generally whiter than their cousins the Shaggy Parasols, but the Shaggys do have a white variant, so apart from the fact Parasols get marginally bigger than shaggys, the way to tell the difference is that the stem of the shaggy parasol will blush reddish when bruised or cut and never has the snakeskin effect of the true Parasol.\nThe Parasol is the better of the two mushrooms to cook with as there are some who suffer slight gastic abnormalities after eating Shaggy Parasols.\nParasols have a great mushroomy flavour, but but don't be fooled by their starting size as they shrink a lot during cooking.",

Naematelia aurantia is a close relatives of Naematelia aurantialba, syn: Tremella aurantialba, the “real” Golden Ear and it is considered an edible and medicinal mushroom in China, and cultivated in large quantities. The story behind this confusion of common names is quite simple. N. aurantialba is only native to China, while N. aurantia has a much broader distribution, it is native to Europe, North & South America, Asia (incl. China) and Australia. Both species parasiting the mycelium of Hairy Curtain Crust, and the two species had been separated only in 1990 (until this point both were known as Golden Ear).\nA rather fresh news that the EU recently gave permission to import Naematelia aurantialba to the EU.

      "fruitingBody": "The upper surface is pale yellowtan to pale grey in younger mushrooms, dark olive brown when more mature, the inner surface is lighter with an off-white bloom. Starting egg shaped becoming bell shaped. Does not have the honeycomb texture of true Morels but can be both smooth andor wrinkled. The stem is joined to the fruiting body very narrowly making the 'cap' appear to balance on the stem.",
      "stem": "Off-white to pale yellowish covered in tiny brown fibrils. Hollow but usually has a cotton wool like pith inside.",
      "flesh": "Thin and fragile.",
      "habitat": "Saprotrophic. Generally found on chalky soil under broad leaved trees and Hawthorn.",
      "possibleConfusion": "Could be confused with the poisonous False Morel (Gyromitra esculenta), pictured, but the fruiting body of the False Morel is usually much more lobed and convoluted and the stem is not smooth but unevenly grooved but great care should be taken when trying to identify the Thimble Morel because of this.",
      "tasteSmell": "Taste and smell not distinctive.\nBecause it is anything but common, if you find it, we suggest recording it and leave it on site.",
      "frequency": "Occasional in the UK, and most probably under recorded.",
      "spores": "Pale orange. Ellipsoid.",
      "otherFacts": "It thought to be both saprophytic and ectomycorrhizal with deciduous trees, but as it seems, it is saprotrophic.\nThe colloquial name “false morels” should only be applied to the species of genus Gyromitra. Using the same colloquial name to species from different genera might be a confusing, because Gyromitras are poisonous, while Verpas are edible.",

      "description": "This small, rare, Morel like mushroom is the only member of genus Verpa in the UK. Many people think it is one of the “false morels”, but it is not. Genus Verpa belongs to the same family as true Morels. To find them takes patience and luck as they blend into their environment and can be very difficult to spot.\nThis mushroom MUST be cooked well before consumption although due to their rarity, we recommend just admiring these mushrooms and leaving them to do their thing.",

Mentioning the amatoxin andor phallotoxin content of Xylaria polymorha without mentioning the actual toxin content of the fruit bodies has almost zero scientific relevance. Xylaria species aren't considered edible in any part of the world and the fact that some started using them as spooky crisps during Halloween won't change this. We don't advice anybody to eat Xylaria species, but we are also against fearmongering which might increase the mycophobia (the irrational fear of mushrooms and other fungal species).",
