      "name": "Blushing Rosette",
      "scientificName": "Abortiporus biennis",
      "Fruiting Body": "Often forms irregular fruit bodies, the below mentioned description describes the regular, rosette form of the species.",
      "Cap": "5-20 cm across, nearly flat, roundish to rosette-like, turns irregularly lobe with age; nearby fruit bodies often fused together. Its upper, sterile surface is initially white to off-white, then pink to reddish brown; smooth to slightly hairy (tomentose). Margin thin and paler than the rest of the upper surface, bruising reddish brown when handled or damaged.",
      "Stem": "4-7 cm long and 2-3 cm thick, tapering towards the base, often deeply 'rooting'.",
      "Pores": "Tubes 5-6 mm long, creamy white. Pores 1-3 per mm (sometimes even wider), irregularly angular to daedaleoid, slightly decurrent; white, staining pink to reddish if damaged.",
      "Flesh": "Dual-layered (duplex), 8-10 mm thick. The upper (external) layer is soft and ochraceous, while the core or inner layer is a bit harder (corky) and more cream in colour.",
      "Habitat": "On all kind of hardwood, often on buried roots, more rarely on conifers. Saprotrophic, causes white-rot, most of all in the roots of deciduous trees. Growing solitary or in smaller groups. Its main fruiting season is Late Summer to Autumn, but it can be found during the whole year.",
      "Possible Confusion": "Young, irregular fruit bodies secrete/oozing red droplets. In this form it can be confused with Devil's Tooth (Hydnellum peckii) and/or Mealy Tooth (Hydnellum ferrugineum), but both species can be found exclusively in old conifer forests, near Pine or Spruce, also these species have spines (teeth), not wide pores.\nThe regular fruit bodies might be confused with the rarer Zoned Rosette (Podoscypha multizonata), pictured, which also prefers hardwoods, especially Oaks, but Zoned Rosette doesn't have visible pores. If we look it more carefully it more reminds of a pink to red stained Wood Cauliflower (Sparassis crispa) than a Blushing Rosette.",
      "Taste / Smell": "Inedible, taste mild, but it has a strange mushroomy smell (some authors describes the smell as somewhat unpleasant).",
      "Frequency": "Occasional and widespread in the UK.",
      "Spores": "Spore print is white. Spores elliptical, colourless (hyaline), and thin walled with oil drops.",
      "Other Facts": "It often forms irregular, aberrant fruit bodies. It could be hemispherical with its pores upside-down, but even if it forms its regular, rosette form, the so-called 'rosecomb mutation' is rather common. In mycology, the term 'rosecomb mutation' is used when any kind of distortions, lumps or malformations occur on the cap and makes visible the gills or the pores.\nIts epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name which identifies the species within the genus) - biennis - suggests it is biennal, but it is incorrect, and likely based on the really variable appearance of this species.",

This mushroom also has hallucinogenic properties which the Lapps have used traditionally in ceremonies and even to round up reindeer who seem to love them.\nConsidered toxic in most modern field guides, and inclusively in our Wild Food UK guide and video, however in a distant past it was frequently consumed in parts of Europe, Asia and North America after preparation. Scientific studies show that there are methods to efficiently remove the toxins and render it safe for consumption, which explains its use in the past. This is something we weren't aware of until recently and doesn't seem to be common knowledge among modern foragers.",

Their species level determination, based on macroscopic features only, is anything but easy and except for a few characteristic species, rather impossible. Thankfully there are a few features that help to recognise them as one of the Grisettes.\nAll the Grisettes are medium or big size agarics (mushrooms with distinct cap, gills and stem), their cap is smooth (except Snakeskin Grisette (Amanita ceciliae) which has thick velar greyish patches on it, and a few other species in this group), margin of their cap is striated, gills are white to cream coloured, there is no ring or skirt around their stem which could be either smooth, covered with a snakeskin-like pattern or with small flakes. Their stem is cylindrical or slightly tapering towards the top of the stem (apex), their volva is saccate (looks like a sac) and very often remains in the soil if you try to pick it.\nAlthough they are considered edible, caution must be taken if foraging for this mushroom as it can look similar to a Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) or another toxic member of the genus.",

Also the cap of the Devil's Bolete being a chalky white but this is less reliable as the cap can fade on older Scarletina Boletes.\nDeceiving bolete (Suillellus queletii) also has dots on the stem but they're yellow to buff/grey and not red.

Modern DNA studies split Boletus into smaller genus allocating this one in Neoboletus. More recently it came to light that the name “erythropus” had been previously used for a different species of Bolete which makes the name scientifically invalid. Recent books list it as “Neoboletus luridiformis” but “luridiformis” isn't a valid name under scientific rules either, and apparently “Boletus praestigiator” was the first valid description of this species. Newer books published after 2017 should be naming it as “Neoboletus praestigiator“.\nFurthermore, the Neoboletus group has a second species, currently named Neoboletus xanthopus, that is extremely similar to the Scarletina Bolete and impossible to differentiate without a DNA analysis. Thankfully this second species is equally edible and it's irrelevant to a forager to distinguish them so we treat the whole group here under Scarletina Bolete.",

      "Possible Confusion": "Because of its wrinkled (merulioid) fertile surface, it is hard to confuse it with anything.\nHowever, when it is young, it might be confused with a young Steccherinum ochraceum (pictured), which has tiny roundish-pointy spines or teeth instead of gills or pores and grows in rather similar habitats as the Netted Crust.",
      "Taste / Smell": "Inedible. Taste and smell indistinctive.",

      "Spores": "Spore print is white. Spores subcylindrical (almost cylindrical), smooth, clear or colourless (hyaline), and inamyloid (not staining in iodine reagents, such as Melzer's reagent and Lugol's solution).",
      "Other Facts": "The scientific name of the species has an interesting origin. There are two slightly different, but still connected explanations of the origin of the name of the genus, Byssomerulius. Every sources agrees on Byssomerulius is a result of merging two words, 'Byssos' + 'Merulius'.\nRobert M. Hallock (PhD) in his book, A Mushroom Word Guide : Etymology, PronounciationAild food Uk & Meaning of over 1.500 Words says, the Greek word 'Byssos' or 'Βύσσος' refers to 'a fine yellow flax'. Hallock forgot to mention that in Greek, 'byssos' can also mean a fine linen made of byssos-flax, and that linen was also yellowish.\nPat O'Reilly, the author of the book, Fascinated by Fungi, says “the genus name, comes via Greek from the Latin byssus, meaning fine silk-like cloth and is probably a reference to the many fine maze-like ridges that pattern the surface of these fungi rather like interlocking jigsaw pieces, and -merulius is the name (origin obscure) of the closely-related Merulius crust fungus genus.”\nWe aren't find the exact etymology of the word 'Merulius', but the word 'meruloid' means: wrinkled with uneven ridges.\nThe epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name) 'corium' comes from Latin, and it means 'leather'.",

      "Habitat": "Mixed woodland and anywhere shady particularly with conifers. Grows in troops or rings but can be found individually.",
      "Possible Confusion": "When young this mushroom looks similar to some of the deadly Amanitas, due to the fact it has a bulbous base, but there is no sac-like structure (volva), and can have a similar looking cap. The confusion with dapperlings (Lepiota spp.) which are smaller can be ignored if the mushroom cap is over twelve centimetres in diameter, when mature nothing that looks similar is anywhere near as big apart from the Parasol mushroom (Macrolepiota procera), pictured and the Brown Parasol (Chlorophyllum brunneum).\nThe Parasol has a snakeskin like dark brown pattern on the stem, the Shaggy Parasol has a smooth off white stem.\nThe brown Parasol has a large, bulbous, marginate base, the Shaggy Parasol has a bulbous base but is not as large and is not marginate.",

If growing on a vertical surface, or the underside of a branch, it might form a rudimentary cap, which can be up to 4 cm wide.\nThe upper (sterile) surface is more or less hairy (hirsute to tomentose), somewhat brownish in colour.\nThe fertile surface is uneven, wrinkled, but could be almost completely smooth too. Pinkish to dark purple at first, becoming dark brownish-violet with age. Especially at the early stages of growing, it often secretes dark purple coloured liquid, this is known as guttation.",
      "Flesh": "1-2 mm thick; soft and elastic when fresh, tough and brittle when dry. Two layered (duplex), the two layer separated by a black line.",
      "Habitat": "On living and dead hardwoods, rarely on conifers. Well-known pathogen (secondary parasite) of members of Rosaceae family, especially different Prunus species, e.g., Plum, Cherry, etc., also of Apple (Malus), Pear (Pyrus), Whitebeam and Rowan (both are Sorbus), causes progressive and often fatal disease, called 'silver leaf disease'.

Skin (exoperidium) is smooth, white, off-white to dark cream coloured. It contains a thin gelatinous layer and the immature, cage-like miniature fruit body (the individual arms are attached at their apex).\nOnce hatched, the witch's egg fruitbody emerges and leaves the remnants of the egg as a volva.\nFruit body is formed of 4-8 finger-like arms, connected with a thick, short stem-like structure. The individual arms are 3-7 cm tall, pinkish to bright red (like red meat flesh), covered with a glutinous layer that contains the spores. Flesh is soft, spongy, fragile, hollowed and somewhat pinkish.",
      "Habitat": "Fruiting in smaller groups, mostly on soil or woodchip mulch. More often recorded from parklands and cemeteries. Saprotrophic on soil.",
      "Possible Confusion": "In its early stage, before hatching it's a witch's egg, pictured, which can be confused with any of our native stinkhorns, but after that it is rather impossible.",
      "Taste / Smell": "Inedible. Taste indistinctive (weakly somewhat radish-like when immature), smell like rotting meat.",
      "Frequency": "As a non-native species, it is rare and rarely recorded, however, it is constantly spreading and appearing more and more areas in South and Southwest England and Cornwall.",
      "Spores": "The spores are trapped into a mucous layer covering the inner wall of the octopus' arms. Spore print is olive-brown, but you can't really make a spore print. Spores elongated-ellipsoid, smooth, thick-walled.",
      "Other Facts": "Described from Tasmania, Australia; It is native to Australia, New Zealand and southern areas of Africa.\nLike all the stinkhorns, it starts its life in an egg-like structure, which is commonly called a witch's egg (in this stage it is considered edible). Once it has hatched it becomes an octopus-like strange looking mushroom. It doesn't have a long shelf-life, a few days after it hatched its egg, it collapses and rots into the substrate.\nSame as all the stinkhorns, this species distributes its spores with the help of insects. The mushroom attracts the insects with its rotting meat-like odour. When the insects land on the inner surface of the mushroom, its spores (trapped into a mucous layer on the inner wall of the individual arms of the 'octopus') attach to their feet and in this way they will leave the spores behind wherever they landing after this encounter.",

Young ones may last 48 hours in the fridge if you are lucky. You can make younger ones last a bit longer in the fridge if you remove the stem before chilling; this seems to delay the transformation into ink.\nYou can also make some very good ink from them.

      "Cap": "6-8 cm. The young small buttons have a chestnut brown cap that can be as small as 1cm. As they grow the cap becomes light brown to pale cream, slightly darker in the centre.",
      "Gills": "Off white to pale pink brown. Crowded and slightly decurrent (the gills run slightly down the stem).",
      "Stem": "7-9 cm long, 1-1.5 cm diameter. It has a long tough stem, often bent when growing in large clusters.\nHas a persistent skirt towards the upper part of the stem.\nIt is creamy white or slightly darker in older specimens, especially at the base.\nQuite often a few specimens will be fused together at the base.",
      "Skirt": "Has a superior, persistent skirt towards the upper part of the stem.",
      "Flesh": "The flesh is white to cream coloured and doesn't change.\nFirm in the cap, tough and fibrous in the stem.",
      "Habitat": "This fungus decomposes dead wood of trees with a preference for Poplar and Willow.\nIts favourite host is the Black Poplar, pictured, Britain's most endangered native tree, now hardly found in the wild. Ornamental cultivars of Black Poplar are often planted in gardens and parks. It can appear occasionally with other broadleaf trees.\nIt grows in large groups from the exposed roots of trees, stumps, cracks on trees, and on fallen decaying wood. Sometimes it may appear on the soil when growing from buried dead roots underneath.",
      "Possible Confusion": "It can be confused with other Fieldcaps in the genus Agrocybe like the Spring Fieldcap (Agrocybe praecox), pictured, They all grow on soil or from woodchip and wood debris, and are generally paler and smaller at maturity.\nThe Wrinkled Fieldcap (Agrocybe rivulosa) is the closest. Smells similar and also has a wrinkled cap, but it grows on woodchip, it's smaller and has a thinner ring.\nSometimes the Poplar Mushroom has a small bent stem and looks similar to an Oyster Mushroom. The spore colour is different and the gills in Oyster mushrooms turn creamy yellow, not brown.",
      "Spore Print": "Brown",
      "Taste / Smell": "Nutty, strong, very pleasant. Very tasty once cooked.",
      "Frequency": "A common appearance where Black Poplars (pictured) are found, occasional with Willow trees.\nOften producing several flushes at different times of the year.",
      "Other Facts": "Although largely ignored by most foragers in the UK this is a very tasty mushroom.\nIt's highly prized in other European countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and France.\nPliny The Elder mentions it was cultivated in ancient Rome, being one of the first mushrooms to be cultivated.\nUntil recently we thought it is also cultivated in Asia and very popular in Chinese cooking and Traditional Chinese Medicine. However, based on molecular evidences, the Chinese species is different, and now it is called Agrocybe chaxingu.",

Its shape depends on the surface it grows, could be semi-circular, shelf-like and somewhat semi-conical too. Broadly attached to the substrate and always thicker at the attachment.\nSterile (upper) surface is cream, beige to ochre, velvety at first, then becoming uneven with small, hard warts. Concentric rings of growths are often can be seen. Margin is sharp and fairly even, often paler than the rest of the upper surface.",

      "Flesh": "2-5 cm thick, tough, corky, more or less homogenous (but sometimes it appears to be zonate).",
      "Habitat": "Most of all it can be found on standing or fallen dead wood of Oaks, but it is rarely recorded from other hardwoods (e.g., Sweet Chestnut) too. It grows solitarily, but often forms tiers. It is not fully clear whether it is a necrotrophic parasite (as some authors suggests) or saprotrophic (as others states), but it is causing brown-rot (of the heartwood of its host).",
      "Possible Confusion": "It is hard to confuse if fully matured, but younger fruit bodies can be confused with other polypores with maze-like pore surface.\nBlushing Bracket (Daedaleopsis confragosa) has thinner pore-walls, and prefers Willows and Poplar over Oaks.\nBirch Mazegill (Trametes betulina, syn: Lenzites betulinus), pictured, has a hairy, suede-like zoned skin, and thinner, more gill-like (lamellate) than maze-like (labyrinthoid) pore surface. It prefers Birch and Beech, but can be found on oaks and other hardwoods too.",
      "Taste / Smell": "Inedible. Smell pleasant, mushroomy, taste not distinctive to slightly bitter, but it has tough texture.",
      "Frequency": "Occasional and widespread in the UK.",
      "Spores": "Spore print is white. Spores ellipsoid, colourless (hyaline), smooth and inamyloid (meaning: there is no starch in the spore wall).",
      "Other Facts": "Oak Mazegill was(!) the type species of the former genus Daedalea. The genus was named after the skillful architect and craftsman, Daedalus [Greek: Δαίδαλος] who built the Labyrinth [Greek: Λαβύρινθος] at Knossos, upon the request of King Minos of Crete, which imprisoned Minotaur [Greek: Μινώταυρος], the monster who had bull head and human body. It is worth reading the whole myth! The epithet, 'quercina' refers to the main host/substrate of this species, which is Oak (Quercus).\nThe scientific name of Oak Mazegill changed recently to Fomitopsis quercina, but apart from mycologists, nobody uses it just yet, so we decided to leave the scientific name as it was before, until the new name became more well-known.\nThis change is supported by DNA-evidence, and the relevant publication is:\nSpirin V, Runnel K, Vlasák J, Viner I, Barrett MD, Ryvarden L, Bernicchia A, Rivoire B, Ainsworth AM, Grebenc T, Cartabia M, Niemelä T, Larsson KH, Miettinen O: The genus Fomitopsis (Polyporales, Basidiomycota) reconsidered.

      "Other Facts": "The Birch Polypore (Fomitopsis betulina), grows on Birch trees and can be a parasite to living trees slowly killing them and then living on the dead tree for many years until the tree has rotted to nothing.\nThe mushroom grows exclusively on Birch naturally but can be artificially introduced to other types of tree.\nIt has long been known that the Birch Polypore has medicinal uses, it has been used as a tonic for the immune system, as an antiseptic to clean wounds and promote healing, a plaster that is microporus, antifungal and antiseptic and probably was used by Bronze Age man to get rid of parasitic worms.\nIn 1991 Austrian hikers in the Tyrol region of the Italian Alps discovered a frozen corpse. When this was later examined it turned out to be a 5300 year old mummy that they named Ötzi. Ötzi had some Birch Polypore on a leather thong around his neck, he also had a parasitic intestinal worm called a Whipworm which can be cured with polyporenic acid which is one of the chemicals present in the Birch Polypore.\nAnother possible use of the fungus by Bronze Age man was as a very good tinder that can be started with a weak spark or used to transport fire as the fungus can smoulder for a long time and can be used to take to the next camp or destination and get a fire lit quickly without the long and laborious task of lighting a fire by friction.\nBirch trees contain betulinic acid which has many health benefits, there are also other chemicals in the Birch Polypore that are beneficial for being healthy. With modern research it is becoming clear that the Birch Polypore is an important mushroom to look into, tests have been carried out and so far found the following.\nAntiviral. In tests extracts from the Birch Polypore blocked reproduction in HIV cells, attacked and incapacitated encephalitis infections and has proved positive in treating flu, yellow fever and West Nile flu.\nAntibiotic. The Birch Polypore contains the antibiotic piptamine which has been used to treat e-coli.\nAnti inflammatory. There are several triterpene acids present and these are known anti-inflammatory substances.\nAnti Tumor. Betulinic acid and other chemicals in the fungi have been shown to cause apoptosis, the destruction of cancer cells while not affecting healthy cells.\nAntiseptic. For cleaning wounds and being an aid to healing.\nAntifungal. This mushroom does not like to share its habitat with other mushrooms and contains some powerful antifungals.\nStyptic. The fungus has styptic properties (it staunches bleeding).\nThe mushroom has very beneficial effects on the immune system and many people drink a tea made from the fresh or dried fungi and swear by its positive effects.\nA plaster can be made from the underside of the mushroom, a strip needs to be cut and carefully removed from the pore membrane. This provides a microporus, anti fungal, antiseptic and self sticking plaster, much better than can be purchased from the shops.\nA corn or blister plaster can be easily fashioned from the flesh of the mushroom by cutting some flesh into a doughnut shape of the right size and applying to the corn or blister.\nThe common name Razor Strop Fungus comes from the use in old barber shops of cutting a strip from the underside of the fungus, drying it and sticking it to a piece of flat wood. This was used to give the final finish to the cut throat razors that barbers used. I'm not sure if they were aware of the fact but in doing so they were giving their blades an antiseptic, antifungal and styptic wipe!\nThe fungus has also been used in the past as very fine emery cloth to polish metals, making ink blotters and even bases for mounting insects for collections.\nTruly the Swiss Army knife of mushrooms.",

Until recently we believed our European Fomitopsis pinicola is native to the American continent too, but molecular studies showed it is a different species, called Fomitopsis mounceae. It might be confusing that F. mounceae is called Red-Belted Polypore in North America.",

However, if you see a non-laccate Ganoderma sp. with distinctive galls mostly on its pore surface, rarely on the sterile upper surface, you can be sure that you have found an Artist's Bracket, because the Yellow Flat-Footed Fly (Agathomyia wankowiczii) only lays its eggs into Artist's Brackets.

      "Habitat": "Grows mostly individually, rarely in smaller groups (a few individual fruitbody can grow out from the same host) on various hardwoods. In the UK the most common hosts are Oaks and Maples. As a necrotrophic parasite, it (slowly) kills its host first, then it will continue to live on the dead wood as a saprotrophic species, an in this stage it causes white-rot.",

It is a perennial, large bracket, growing on various hardwoods (preferably Willows and Oaks), mostly without forming a stem, but if it grows directly from the roots of a tree, it might have a stem.\nGanoderma carnosum, its main host is Silver Fir (Abies alba), but more rarely it can be found on/around other conifers too.",

      "Frequency": "It is occasional to rare in the UK.",
      "Other Facts": "The scientific name of the species has mixed origin. The genus name 'Ganoderma' is made of 2 different Greek words, ganos or γανος means 'brightness', derma or δερμα means 'skin', so altogether means 'shiny or bright skin', while the epithet (2nd part of the scientific name) 'lucidum' comes from the Latin word 'lucidus' which means bright, shiny, etc.\nGanoderma lucidum was first described by William Curtis, a British mycologist in Flora Londinensis in 1781 as Boletus lucidus.\nUntil recently we thought that Ganoderma lucidum is the same species as the Reishi, the highly praised medicinal mushroom from Asia, but we were wrong. Our Ganoderma lucidum is a European species, not native to Asia. The legendary Reishi or Lingzhi (Ganoderma sichuanense, syn: Ganoderma lingzhi) is a similar looking, but completely different species (they aren't even in the same clade within the genus). However, because of the huge amount of money being invested to promote the health benefits of Reishi, this well-known scientific fact won't reach the marketing department/team of food supplement manufacturers for a long time…",

It is sitting on the inner surface of the arms (exoperidium) without having any visible supportive stem-like structure (sessile).\nSpore exit (peristom) is raised-conical, fibrous without ridges, and surrounded by a small boundary-halo. Often covered with brown spore powder.\nSpore-bearing tissue of the 'head', called the 'gleba' is creamy and solid (cheese-like) when immature, powdery and brown when the spores matured.\nOuter layer (exoperidium) cracks up to 5-8 arms. The inner surface of the arms brake off and form a saucer or collar-like structure (hence the common English name). It is more or less creamy in the inside, darker brownish on the outside. The arms bend round underneath the fruitbody and lift it up from the soil.",
      "Habitat": "Grows on nutrient rich soil, both under deciduous and coniferous trees, preferably on slopes, much less likely on flat areas. Saprotrophic.",
      "Possible Confusion": "It can be confused with other Earthstars, such as Rufous Earthstar (Geastrum rufescens), pictured, Geastrum saccatum, or Sessile Earthstar (Geastrum fimbriatum), especially if we found an immature (unopened) fruit body.\nThe peristom of Rufous Earthstar (Geastrum rufescens, pictured) doesn't have a boundary-halo, and when its arms crack, they are reddening in the cracks.\nGeastrum saccatum is much smaller than the Collared Earthstar (Geastrum michelianum), about half of its size, and its arms rather flatten on the soil than crawling under and lift up the fruit body. In a recent phylogeny study by Zamora JC et al (2014) proved that G. michelianum and G. saccatum are two different species from two different sections of genus Geastrum.\nThe peristom of Sessile Earthstar (Geastrum fimbriatum) doesn't have a boundary-halo, also, the inner layer of its arms doesn't brake off and form a collar, not to mention that it is smaller than the Collared Earthstar (Geastrum michelianum).",

      "Other Facts": "The scientific name of the genus comes from ancient Greek, where 'geo' means Earth, 'aster' means Star. The epithet (2nd part of the scientific name) refers to the mostly visible three layers of the mature fruit body: the spherical head or spore sac (endoperidium), the broken off inner layer of the arms, and the arms (exoperidium).\nUntil recently it was called as Geastrum triplex, however, the original Geastrum triplex was described from a Tropical deciduous forest on Java, Indonesia, and has a different DNA to our European Geastrum “triplex“, so we tend to use its former name, Geastrum michelianum, which - in our opinion - should be the valid scientific name of the European species.",

      "Stem": "5-10 cm long, varying width due to shape. White, often short, furrowed specially towards the base.\nThe inside consisting of hollow chambers.",
      "Flesh": "The mushroom is mostly hollow.\nThe flesh is brittle and pale white to cream coloured, sometimes yellowish in the cap.\nIt has a strong and pleasant smell.",
      "Habitat": "Under Pine trees, usually in sandy soil rich in woody debris.",
      "Possible Confusion": "True Morels like the Black Morel (photo on the left), the Common Morel (Morchella vulgaris) or the Morel (Morchella esculenta) have often been confused.\nBut true Morels have fully hollow caps covered in pits and ridges that form a honeycomb structure. In contrast the False Morel has an irregular convoluted cap with several hollow chambers inside.\nThe Thimble Morel (Verpa conica) is a slender mushroom with a cap hanging on top of the stem. The cap has less pronounced wrinkles in contrast with the deep lobes of the False Morel.\nOther species of Gyromitra exist in Europe but they are rarely recorded in the UK.",
      "Taste / Smell": "Slightly sweet. Poisonous when raw, do not swallow.",
      "Frequency": "Uncommon.",
      "Other Facts": "In the digestive system the gyromitrin is hydrolyzed into Monomethylhydrazine (MMH), a chemical better known for its use as a rocket propellant. The poisoning caused by MMH has a range of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Serious cases lead to liver and kidney damage as well as seizures and coma, sometimes resulting in death.\nThe amount of gyromitrin varies a lot from collection to collection but it's usually very high. Consumed raw or in large amounts it can be fatal. However this mushroom and related species have a long history of consumption in parts of Europe and North America.\nGyromitrin is volatile and soluble in water and it's possible to remove most of it following a rigorous method. The processing should be done outdoors or on a well ventilated space to avoid inhaling the highly toxic vapours. We don't recommend trying unless you understand very well the caveats associated with this species and toxin.\nThere are many species of Gyromitra spread across the World, some more distinct than others. A couple of these contain high amounts of gyromitrin, others only contain trace amounts and some may not even contain the toxin. This leads to much confusion and debate among mycologists and foragers in different geographic areas. Most authors currently dismiss all Gyromitra species as suspicious, but in some areas the local species are regarded as edible after simple cooking. We use the term “False Morel” to specifically refer to Gyromitra esculenta, the most commonly recorded Gyromitra species in the UK. Enthusiasts see it as a derogatory term for this unique fungi, but this is the official common name sanctioned by the British Mycological Society.",

      "Cap": "1-10 cm. Very varied being yellow, orange or red, or a mixture of all three on one cap. The cap is conical until opening out flat and turning black with age or handling. While young, the cap feels dry but still waxy and has what look like radial fibres.",
      "Gills": "Starting white to yellow but soon turning black with age or handling. Has tiny lateral 'ribs' between the gills which are fairly wide spaced. Fairly crowded and free of the stem to slightly joined (adnexed).",
      "Stem": "1-10 cm long, 0.2-1.5 cm diameter. Yellow to orange particularly towards the top, off white to grey lower down and vertically fibrillose. As with all parts of this mushroom the stem will turn black when handled or left to mature.",

Often secreting very pale yellow to amber coloured droplets (this phenomenon is called: guttation).",
      "Flesh": "Up to 5 cm thick. Azonate, yellowish, soft, hygrophanous, spongy to fleshy when young, dark brown to black, brittle when dry. Turns black with KOH.",
      "Habitat": "Growing on living deciduous broadleaf trees. Its most common hosts are probably Ash and Oak in the UK, but commonly found on fruit-bearing trees in gardens, parklands, old orchards and forests. Necrotrophic parasite, causing white-rot of sapwood and the crack of the wood along the annual ring.",
      "Possible Confusion": "It is almost unmistakable when young, but when its is dry, there are a few possible confusions.\nChaga, the sterile conk (sclerotium) of Inonotus obliquus, pictured, is rather rare in England, more common in Scotland, and regardless it may grow on a few hardwood genera, it is more common on Birch. If you crack it or cut it, the inside of Chaga is reddish brown, but without having any tubes or pores.\nThe old and dry fruit body of Dyer's Mazegill (Phaeolus schweinitzii) might look similar, but it is a root parasitic species of conifers (rarely of broadleaf, deciduous trees too) with a noticeable stem.",

      "Habitat": "On calcareous soil under broad-leaved trees, particularly Beech.",
      "Possible Confusion": "Since it appears at the end of Spring and early Summer it may be confused with a late flushing St George's Mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), pictured. However the St. George's Mushroom doesn't stain red, its cap doesn't have radial fibres, its spores are whitish cream and its smell is distinctive.\nThere are many other species of red staining Fibrecaps that may look very similar but appearing in Autumn. Since all Fibrecaps are suspected of being very poisonous all should be avoided by the forager. Identifying the different species of Fibrecaps (Inocybe spp., Inosperma spp., Mallocybe spp., Pseudosperma spp.) with precision is often a task for the mycologist well equipped with a microscope.",
      "Spore Print": "Dull brown. Ellipsoid.",
      "Taste / Smell": "The smell is strong and pungent but hard to describe. It is sometimes compared to honey, fruit or perfumed soap.\nAlthough the flesh is said to taste sweet, we don't recommend tasting this mushroom due to its toxicity.",
      "Frequency": "Common in Southern England where suitable habitat (woodland on chalky soil) occurs, reappearing every year in the same woodland. Rare in other parts of the country.",
      "Other Facts": "The Deadly Fibrecap is considered the most toxic of all Fibrecaps, but all species of this genus are suspected of being poisonous and should all be avoided. The Fibrecaps are identified by the radial fibres in the cap, the fibrous stem and the dull brown spore print. Most are little brown mushrooms and quickly dismissed by foragers.\nThe toxin found in these mushrooms is muscarine which causes gastric upsets, excessive sweating and salivation, slower heart rate and can lead to death. The Deadly Fibrecap is known for containing a deadly amount of muscarine and deaths associated to this mushroom have occurred in the UK and Continental Europe in the past century. The antidote for muscarine poisoning is atropine, a substance better known for being the main toxin in the Deadly Nightshade plant. Those who have been poisoned by the mushroom should never attempt to use the plant as an antidote as atropine can be deadly itself and administration of medicinal dosage should only be done by a qualified professional.",

We aren't aware of its existence in the UK, but there is an ongoing research which wishes to determine the number of native Laetiporus species in the UK.\nLaetiporus imbricatus looks just a bit paler than our Laetiporus sulphureus.

Some people can have an allergic reaction so only a small amount should be tried when first tasting this mushroom. Also see Other Facts below for notes on Yew.",
      "Frequency": "Fairly common.",
      "Other Facts": "One of the most common hosts for this fungus is the very poisonous Yew tree, and it is often said that the fungus will absorb the toxic alkaloids (Taxine and Taxane) from the tree. Some mycologists have said that this is unlikely, and some foragers have reported eating it from yew repeated times without any issue. However we have also had reports of severe gastric upsets after consumption from Yew. In any case, the toxic alkaloids found in Yew are very resilient and can be found even on dead wood and fallen needles. Therefore specimens collected from Yew should be very carefully inspected, trimmed and cleaned thoroughly to remove any needles or wood debris trapped inside. At this point we cannot recommend collecting Chicken of the Woods from Yew as safe. It is a common fungus and you should be able to find it in other trees.\nVery popular in North America where they sometimes blanch and freeze it although when I have tried this it tends to become very woody, it is best eaten when young and fresh.",

      "Fruiting Body": "6-20 cm tall, 5-10 cm wide, pear or pestle shaped with a distinct head and a sterile, stem-like structure which holds up the head. The outer layer or skin (ectoperidium) covered with spiny granules. Whitish when young, creamy to grey brown with age. The inner layer or inner wall (endoperidium) is ochraceous, papery and thin. When the spores have matured, the endoperidium opens up releasing its spores and then disappearing with age. The stem-like sterile structure persistently remains after the spores have been released.",
      "Stem": "Does not have a true stem but a sterile stem like structure which can persist throughout the year after the fertile head has disappeared.",
      "Flesh": "It is called gleba in the head. The gleba is white when young, then green to olive-brown as the spores develop.",
      "Habitat": "On soil, preferably in woodlands, both under deciduous trees and conifers, occasionally on grasslands and in hedgerows. Grows solitary, in small groups.",
      "Possible Confusion": "When young, it might be confused with smaller, white puffballs from genus Lycoperdon.\nCommon Puffball (Lycoperdon perlatum), pictured, is generally much smaller, its colour is paler, whitish to cream, also its head is covered with easily falling spines.\nMosaic Puffball (Lycoperdon utriforme) is a medium to large puffball, but it prefers unimproved grasslands, and its head is covered with pyramid-like warts.",

      "Habitat": "Open woods and pastures, often among ferns, on verges between roads and woods or fields.",
      "Possible Confusion": "When young this mushroom looks very similar to some of the deadly amanitas, due to the fact it emerges from a sack-like structure and can have a similar looking cap. The confusion with other lepiotas which are smaller can be ignored if the mushroom cap is over twelve centimetres in diametre, when mature nothing that looks similar is anywhere near as big apart from the Shaggy Parasol (Chlorophyllum rhacodes), pictured. The shaggy does not grow quite as large and is slightly off-white to dusty in colour, the stem has no snakeskin effect and the flesh stains red when cut.

      "Other Facts": "Parasols can be found alone but generally they are found in rings or sometimes troops. As stated above, nothing else really gets this big apart from Shaggy Parasols. You can often spot them from quite a distance along the edges of fields, woods and roads.\nParasols are generally whiter than their cousins the Shaggy Parasols, but the Shaggys do have a white variant, so apart from the fact Parasols get marginally bigger than shaggys, the way to tell the difference is that the stem of the shaggy parasol will blush reddish when bruised or cut and never has the snakeskin effect of the true Parasol.\nThe Parasol is the better of the two mushrooms to cook with as there are some who suffer slight gastic abnormalities after eating Shaggy Parasols.\nParasols have a great mushroomy flavour, but but don't be fooled by their starting size as they shrink a lot during cooking.",

The main difference between the two is that the gills of C. rivulosa run down the stem (decurrent) and those of the Fairy Ring are not attached to the stem. Also the edge of the cap of C. rivulosa mainly stays in-turned even when the mushroom has opened out. The colours are different with the C. rivulosa being lighter to white with concentric rings sometimes visable on the cap while the Fairy Ring is more light tan often with a slightly darker, wide umbo in the centre of the cap.

      "Other Facts": "Very common in late spring early summer but towards the end of the season they generally become too infested with maggots.\nEasy to spot as the grass grows taller and greener in the ring.

Size and colour can vary greatly within this particular mushroom, many varieties have been described by mycologists.",
      "Stem": "White/cream, hollow sometimes widening towards a bulbous base. Uneven furrows run vertically up the stem.",
      "Flesh": "Fairly thin, white on the inside. It has a faint pleasant smell that intensifies after drying.",
      "Habitat": "Open woods, pastures, gardens, wasteland, gravel and often on verges between roads and woods or fields. Also on sand dunes. It is mostly reported from poor alkaline soils such as chalk and limestone.",
      "Possible Confusion": "The False Morel (Gyromitra esculenta), pictured, but this is more lobed or brain-like rather than the pitted and honeycomb like cap of the morel. The False Morel also differs in not having a completely hollow cap.\nThe Black Morel (Morchella importuna) can be similar, even in colour when young, but usually the ridges are arranged in fairly regular vertical lines, unlike the completely random honeycomb of the Yellow Morels. The ridges on the Black Morel also become darker than the rest of the cap with age, unlike the paler ridges of Yellow Morels.\nThe Common Morel (Morchella vulgaris) is very closely related to the Morel. It is usually more grey in colour specially when young. The ridges of the cap are thicker and the pits are more irregular and labyrinthic in shape. The Morel has thinner edges and polygonal shaped pits. Intermediate forms exist that may be hard to differentiate at the very young or very mature stage.\nThe “Morels” are a large group (technically called a clade or section) of very similar species, and mycologists still haven't established exactly how many species exist, their distribution, and how they differ from each other.

      "Flesh": "Thin and white on the inside. It has a faint pleasant smell that intensifies with drying.",

      "Possible Confusion": "The False Morel (Gyromitra esculenta), pictured, but this is more lobed or brain-like rather than the pitted and honeycomb like cap of the morel. The False Morel also differs in not having a completely hollow cap.\nThe Stinkhorn (Phallus impudicus) can also look similar to those who are unfamiliar with it, but the strong foul smell quickly denounces its identity. It appears in Summer and Autumn when Morels are no longer around.\nThe Morel (Morchella esculenta) or Common Morel (Morchella vulgaris) can look similar, even in colour, but usually the ridges on the cap of the Black Morel have fairly regular vertical lines unlike the randomly arranged honeycomb of the other two. The ridges on a Black Morel become darker than the rest of the cap, while in Common Morel and Morel they are paler (or sometimes bruise orange red).\nThe Semifree Morel is very closely related, but it's easily distinguished by it's smaller cap that is attached to the stem halfway.\nThe Black Morel (Morchella importuna) here described and the Semifree Morel (Morchella semilibera) are both part of a wider group colloquially called the “Black Morels”.

      "Other Facts": "The Black Morel of wood-chip beds has become very common and persistent mushroom hunters are rewarded with large amounts each season. On the other hand, the related Black Morel species growing in wild habitats seem rarer and harder to find than any other Morels in the UK. Although wilder collections are tastier than the wood-chip counterparts, they're still tasty mushrooms and very worth eating. They work well in a variety of recipes, in particular in rich sauces. As pointed above they need to be well cooked, so no lightly tossed Morels.",

It has rather similar coloured cap and stem too, but the edge of its gills are white and its spores are red-brown in Melzer's reagent (under microscope).\nDewdrop Mottlegill (Panaeolus acuminatus) is similar in size and grows on the same habitat as Brown Mottlegill, however it has black spores, the gills mottled with black and becoming entirely black with maturation, but the easiest way to separate the two species is to check the gills in wet weather. Dewdrop Mottlegill often have water droplets on/around the gills which turns black because of the spores, hence its common name.\nBanded Mottlegill (Panaeolus cinctulus) is growing out of cow or horse manure (incl. middens). It is slightly bigger than Dewdrop Mottlegill, and it is more reddish-brown than its relative. According to D. Arora, it contains psilocybin which - if it is a correct info - makes it as a Class A drug in the UK, however, this information cannot be confirmed by UK authors.",

It is also possible that it was confused with one of its toxic lookalikes.\nThere are some reports about it might be toxic to children if consumed in large enough quantities, but eating raw mushrooms may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms even if the mushroom itself is not toxic at all, so we stick to the international (European) classification and consider this species as inedible only.",

      "Other Facts": "The epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name) refers to its shape, conchatus means looks like a shell (it became an English word as conchate and/or conchiform).\nIt is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) where it is called 'Zi Ge Er' meaning 'Purple Leather Ear', however, it is not one of the most commonly used TCM drugs.",

      "Possible Confusion": "Most of all it can be confused with other members of the Russula sect. Ingratae.\nStinking Brittlegill (Russula foetens) is more robust, has a more glutinous cap, and has a stronger smell than the Least Stinking Brittlegill (R. subfoetens), otherwise it is hard to differentiate it without chemicals or microscopy. The Stinking Brittlegill gives different reaction to KOH (doesn't react to KOH on the flesh whereas the Least Stinking Brittlegill will stain blue), and has bigger warts (up to 1.4 μm) on the spores than its lookalike.\nCamembert Brittlegill (Russula amoenolens) has a spermatic smell, and an unpleasantly hot taste.",

Both species parasiting the mycelium of Hairy Curtain Crust, and the two species had been separated only in 1990 (until this point both were known as Golden Ear).\nA rather fresh news that the EU recently gave permission to import Naematelia aurantialba to the EU.

Margin is sharp, always paler, whitish grey, whitish ochre.\nFertile surface is smooth (or uneven, slightly warty), variable, yellowish to ochraceous at first, fading to somewhat more greyish ochre with age, staining yellow when cut or bruised.",
      "Flesh": "Very thin (up to 0.5 mm), tough and elastic when moist, leathery and brittle when dry, reddish buff.",
      "Habitat": "On the dead wood of hardwoods, especially on Beech and Sycamore. Saprotrophic, causes white-rot.",
      "Possible Confusion": "It is most often confused with Hairy Curtain Crust (Stereum hirsutum), pictured, which has a more yellow margin, and doesn't have any red on its hairy cap.\nAlso, often confused with False Turkeytail (Stereum ostrea), but we can't turn a blind eye to the fact that Stereum ostrea seems to be a species complex of at least 2-3 rather similar looking species (especially if we think about the North American collections).",

At the beginning, it is egg-shaped (ovoid), then bell-shaped (campanulate) to convex, usually with a distinct umbo at the centre of the cap. Its skin is whitish cream and covered in long, shiny, silky-hairy fibres. Cap margin is often in-rolled, sometimes hairy (fibrillose). Can have parts of the veil/egg remaining on the cap.",
      "Gills": "Crowded, free, white when young, turning pink with maturity. The edge of the gills are lightly scalloped.",
      "Stem": "7-15 cm tall, 1-2 cm wide, cylindrical, tapering towards the apex, bulbous at base. Creamy white, same as the cap, shiny-scaly, powdery at the apex. It emerges from a persistent, bag-like volva.\nVolva\nThick and membranous. Whitish before hatching, turns ochre to even brownish with age, its surface often cracked, and once hatched, it remains around the stem base as a persistent bag.",
      "Habitat": "Saprobic on dead or weak, but living hardwood, preferably Elm, Beech, Oak, Sycamore and other Maples, most often be found growing from knots or damage to living trees. Growing solitary or in small groups in parks or woodlands.",
      "Possible Confusion": "The Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa) pictured, is similar but has a skirt, a smooth rather than shaggy cap although both can have bits of veil still attached and it grows in soil, not on wood.\nThe Stubble Rosegill (Volvopluteus gloiocephalus), is similar but again has a smooth, not hairy cap and grows in soil not on wood.",
      "Spore Print": "Pink (to brown). Ellipsoid, smooth and thick walled.",
      "Taste / Smell": "It has a faint radish-like smell and a mild and radish-like taste. It is edible, some say excellent but due the uncommon nature of this mushroom, we consider it off the menu.",
      "Frequency": "Uncommon.",

      "Gills": "Crowded, free, broad. Whitish at first, then pale pink, later becoming flesh pink.",
      "Stem": "Cylindrical, tapering upwards, easily removable from cap. Whitish, surface smooth, growing from a distant, bag-like whitish to grey volva, absent ring.\nVolva\nWhitish grey, substantial, membranous and persistent. Often deep in the soil, under the soil's surface.",
      "Flesh": "Off white, soft and moist.",
      "Habitat": "Saprotrophic on various, nutrient-rich substrates, e.g., manured or fertilised soil of parks, gardens, fields or woodlands. Also on woodchip beds, compost heaps, etc.",
      "Possible Confusion": "Whitish coloured specimens could be confused with:\nDestroying Angel (Amanita virosa), pictured, can look similar despite their habitats being different and it has a skirt, unlike the Stubble Rosegill.\nIn mainland Europe, it could be confused with Amanita verna, which is also one of the species that can be called the Destroying Angel.\nThe greyish coloured specimens could be confused with:\nThe Grisette (Amanita vaginata), and other Grisettes (Amanita sect. Vaginatae), but they have more distinct volval bags.",

Once flattened, often concentrically zonate. Pale yellow brown to reddish brown, darkens to tobacco brown to almost black with age. Margin rounded, sometimes radially wrinkled.",
      "Pores": "Tubes 3-8 mm long, rusty brown to amber brown with a thin, silvery covering layer (pruina). Pores 2-4 per mm, round-angular to irregularly rounded, covered with tiny hairs (which only can be observed with a magnifying lens from a certain angle), silvery grey to yellowish, yellow brown, bruises darker rusty brown.",
      "Flesh": "Up to 1 cm thick, fairly zonate. Soft at first, then corky to woody, becoming fragile at the end. Yellowish brown at first, then turns dark brown.",
      "Habitat": "Almost always on dying or dead wood of Alder (Alnus), rarely on Birch (Betula) or other broadleaves. Necrotrophic parasite (some authors say saprotrophic on wood), causes white-rot.",
      "Possible Confusion": "It is hard to confuse with other species.\nOak Bracket (Pseudoinonotus dryadeus) might look similar for some, but it is a root parasitic species, mostly growing around the roots of an Oak (Quercus) or a Chestnut (Castanea). It is a common species and much larger than Alder Bracket.\nMensularia nodulosa, pictured, grows on Beech (Fagus), and it is really rarely recorded and has a NT - Near Threatened status on the Red Data List (2006).",
      "Taste / Smell": "Inedible. Smell and taste not distinctive.",
      "Frequency": "Widespread and common on the British Isles.",
      "Spores": "Spore print whitish to pale yellowish. Spores ellipsoid to almost spherical (subglobose), colourless (hyaline) to yellowish, thick-walled, smooth and dextrinoid (turning reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent).",
      "Other Facts": "Like many current or former Inonotus species, Alder Bracket often guttates (secrets sticky droplets without any sort of cell damage). The droplets are translucent to pale amber at beginning, darkening with age and might leave some drop marks on the sterile upper surface.\nThe epithet (2nd part of the scientific name) 'radiata' means 'having radiating markings'.\nIt is more common in Northern Europe, much less frequent in the Mediterranean region. It is widespread and common in Northeastern, North Central and Southern regions of the US.",

It hosts hundreds of individual fruit bodies.\nThe stroma is really variable by shape and size, it could be 7-8 cm tall and 1-3 cm wide. It is upright, compressed, needle-like to more or less branching, like a stag's antler, (hence the common English name). It is initially greyish, covered with fine white-grey dust (conidia), turning dark, almost black with maturation. The stroma's surface is covered with black, sub-spherical, pimple-like tiny fruit bodies (called perithecia) which can hardly be detected by the naked eye. The lower, sterile, stem-like supportive part of the stroma is black and more or less hairy.",
      "Flesh": "Really thin, white and more or less tough.",
      "Habitat": "Saprotrophic on dead wood of deciduous trees, including fallen branches, and occasionally can be seen on conifer stumps too. Might be acting as weak parasite on ailing, injured or stressed trees. It is a really common species in any sort of woodlands, urban parks, etc.",
      "Possible Confusion": "It is really hard to confuse with anything else, but some authors says it might or could be confused with Beechmast Candlesnuff (Xylaria carpophila), pictured, so let's look at the difference between these two species:\nCandlesnuff Fungus is growing on the dead wood of hardwood trees, (also, rarely, on heavily decayed conifer stumps), while Beechmast Candlesnuff is growing on decaying beechmast.\nCandlesnuff Fungus forks like the antler of a stag, while Beechmast Candlesnuff is not forked at all.",
      "Taste / Smell": "Inedible. Smell and taste not distinctive.",

      "Other Facts": "The species is a subject of pharmacological researches. Some of its biologically active compounds, such as xylarial A and B showed moderate cytotoxic activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Its pyrone-derivatives, (such as xylarone and 8,9-dehydroxylarone), which were isolated from the submerged culture of X. hypoxylon strain A27-94, showed cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell-lines in vitro.",

      "Flesh": "White and more or less tough. Taste and smell indistinctive. Traditionally it is not considered edible in any part of the world.",
      "Habitat": "Saprotrophic on dead woods of various hardwoods (deciduous trees), but preferably Beech, grows out of fallen woods, the roots or stumps of dead trees. It causes a so-called soft-rot (instead of breaking down cellulose and causing brown-rot, or breaking down lignin and causing white-rot, it is breaking down the glucans which act as a binding agent “or glue” between these two).",
      "Possible Confusion": "It could be confused with other Xylaria species, most of all the much skinnier Dead Moll's Fingers (Xylaria longipes).",
      "Frequency": "It is very common and widespread in the UK.",

      "Other Facts": "There is a study by Debnath S et al (2018) which claims that Xylaria polymorpha (and the other four Xylaria species in India) contains amatoxins or phallotoxins (unfortunately the study doesn't elaborate which one), also, their study doesn't mention the actual amatoxin and/or phallotoxin content of the fruit bodies of each species they wrote about. Mentioning the amatoxin and/or phallotoxin content of Xylaria polymorha without mentioning the actual toxin content of the fruit bodies has almost zero scientific relevance. Xylaria species aren't considered edible in any part of the world and the fact that some started using them as spooky crisps during Halloween won't change this. We don't advice anybody to eat Xylaria species, but we are also against fearmongering which might increase the mycophobia (the irrational fear of mushrooms and other fungal species).",
