      "description": "A beautiful, wide-pored annual polypore with a varied appearance. Its most common form is the rosette form, but it has many different irregular forms, including an upside-down, hemispherical form too.",
      "scientificName": "Abortiporus biennis",
      "start": "All",
      "end": "All",
      "capHeight": "",
      "capWidth": "5-20",
      "fruitingBody": "Often forms irregular fruit bodies, the below mentioned description describes the regular, rosette form of the species.\nCap 5-20 cm across, nearly flat, roundish to rosette-like, turns irregularly lobe with age; nearby fruit bodies often fused together. Its upper, sterile surface is initially white to off-white, then pink to reddish brown; smooth to slightly hairy (tomentose). Margin thin and paler than the rest of the upper surface, bruising reddish brown when handled or damaged.\nStem 4-7 cm long and 2-3 cm thick, tapering towards the base, often deeply 'rooting'.",
      "pores": "Tubes 5-6 mm long, creamy white. Pores 1-3 per mm (sometimes even wider), irregularly angular to daedaleoid, slightly decurrent; white, staining pink to reddish if damaged.",
      "flesh": "Dual-layered (duplex), 8-10 mm thick. The upper (external) layer is soft and ochraceous, while the core or inner layer is a bit harder (corky) and more cream in colour.",
      "habitat": "On all kind of hardwood, often on buried roots, more rarely on conifers. Saprotrophic, causes white-rot, most of all in the roots of deciduous trees. Growing solitary or in smaller groups. Its main fruiting season is Late Summer to Autumn, but it can be found during the whole year.",
      "confusion": "Young, irregular fruit bodies secrete/oozing red droplets. In this form it can be confused with Devil's Tooth (Hydnellum peckii) and/or Mealy Tooth (Hydnellum ferrugineum), but both species can be found exclusively in old conifer forests, near Pine or Spruce, also these species have spines (teeth), not wide pores.\nThe regular fruit bodies might be confused with the rarer Zoned Rosette (Podoscypha multizonata), pictured, which also prefers hardwoods, especially Oaks, but Zoned Rosette doesn't have visible pores. If we look it more carefully it more reminds of a pink to red stained Wood Cauliflower (Sparassis crispa) than a Blushing Rosette.",
      "taste": "Inedible, taste mild, but it has a strange mushroomy smell (some authors describes the smell as somewhat unpleasant).",
      "facts": "It often forms irregular, aberrant fruit bodies. It could be hemispherical with its pores upside-down, but even if it forms its regular, rosette form, the so-called 'rosecomb mutation' is rather common. In mycology, the term 'rosecomb mutation' is used when any kind of distortions, lumps or malformations occur on the cap and makes visible the gills or the pores.\nIts epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name which identifies the species within the genus) - biennis - suggests it is biennal, but it is incorrect, and likely based on the really variable appearance of this species.",

Their stem is cylindrical or slightly tapering towards the top of the stem (apex), their volva is saccate (looks like a sac) and very often remains in the soil if you try to pick it.\nAlthough they are considered edible, caution must be taken if foraging for this mushroom as it can look similar to a Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) or another toxic member of the genus.",

The inner layer (endoperidium) is deeply striated or grooved, shiny, silky and grey coloured. The peridium is initially covered with thin, whitish membraneous seal (called: epiphragm) which is the same shaggy or tomentose as the rest of the outer layer. When the spores matured, epiphragm loses its hairs and breaks (in this way the fruitbody opens up). When rain falls, it triggers the funiculi (singular: funiculum) and shoots out the peridioles with a range of a few metres.",

This was used to give the final finish to the cut throat razors that barbers used. I'm not sure if they were aware of the fact but in doing so they were giving their blades an antiseptic, antifungal and styptic wipe!\nThe fungus has also been used in the past as very fine emery cloth to polish metals, making ink blotters and even bases for mounting insects for collections.\nTruly the Swiss Army knife of mushrooms.",

The Morel has thinner edges and polygonal shaped pits looking more honeycomb like than the labyrinthic pits of the Common Morel. Intermediate forms exist that may be hard to differentiate. The Common Morel (Morchella vulgaris), is actually part of the “Morels” group. The “Morels” are a large group (technically called a clade or section) of very similar species, and mycologists still haven't established exactly how many species exist, their distribution, and how they differ from each other. The forager shouldn't worry about precise distinction as all Morels seem to be excellent edibles.",

      "facts": "While highly sought after, this can be a difficult mushroom to go out looking for and is usually found accidentally while looking for other edibles.\nAlthough there are recipes at the bottom of the page the Common Morel is such a delicious and hard to find mushroom that it is best simply cooked in butter and seasoned. As pointed out above it just needs to be well cooked, so no lightly tossed Morels.",
